      <a href="https://travis-ci.com" target="_blank">Travis CI</a> is a hosted continuous integration service 
      created in 2011 to serve the Open Source community from which it began. Integrated with GitHub, 
      Travis CI offers first class support to many programming languages including Python, Go, PHP, Java, C++, and Ruby. 
      Travis CI also launched <a
      href="http://foundation.travis-ci.org">Travis Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization which aims to make 
      Open Source a diverse and inclusive place. One of Travis Foundation’s main efforts is Rails Girls Summer of Code which 
      helps individuals from underrepresented groups begin their careers in programming.
