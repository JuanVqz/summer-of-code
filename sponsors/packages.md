    <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code enables women and non-binary people to work on Open Source projects from July to September each year while receiving a monthly scholarship. You can help make this a reality by becoming a Rails Girls Summer of Code sponsor or by donating as an individual.</p>
    <p>Our various sponsorship packages are detailed below.</p>

    <h2>Why you should become a sponsor</h2>

    <p>By sponsoring RGSoC, you will directly help individual women and non-binary people get into Open Source, but it also comes with benefits for the community at large.</p>

    <h2>Sponsorship Packages</h2>
    <p>Supporting RGSoC enables our students to dedicate themselves to their Open Source learning projects full-time because their living expenses are covered by a monthly stipend. As a sponsor, you play a crucial part in making this happen, funding the budget pool from which the selected students will be paid.</p>

    <p>If you would like to know more about RGSoC or present our program to your company, you can also take a look at this <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/alicetragedy/rgsoc-2018-sponsor-pitch">pitch deck</a>.</p>
