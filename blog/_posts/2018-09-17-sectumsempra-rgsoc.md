# “How lucky are we to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard!” 

As our RGSoC journey is near its close, we can’t begin to express how heart-wrenching for us, it is going to be to bid our farewell. 
While RGSoC has been in itself has been a transforming experience, it also more importantly for us, had a greater impact, of validation 
in our lives. Apart from being a delightful experience,  it proved to be a much needed boost to our confidence, that we are marching 
the right way forward towards establishing ourselves in the field of Information Technology and Computer Science.

## A word of gratitude
### With Love to our supervisor and friend Nada:
We are ever so grateful for the continuous support of our lovely supervisor Nada. She has been a friend and guide, and we have learnt so much from all that she shared with us. We will definitely miss having our weekly calls and discussions with her. Thank you so much Nada. 
### The Chapel Community, Our mentors and coaches:
We were able to embark on this wonderful journey due to the endeavours an constant encouragement from our mentors Michael and Ben, our forever helpful coaches and guides Louis and Engin, and also our other coaches Ian, Lydia, to whom we are forever grateful. 
There were so many times we were stuck and needed guidance, and our mentors and coaches always came to our rescue. They helped us to explore topics, completely unknown to us and devoid of our understanding.  More so, as guides they helped us to tread on the correct path.
And this is the main reason why our goodbye’s wouldn’t be easy, and our heartfelt gratitude, never enough.

### The RGSoC Organizers and the community:
The RGSoC community has been simply wonderful, we got a chance to make new friends and learn from their experiences. Right from the day, we received the acceptance email from the organizers, it has been a magical experience. We are ever so grateful to the RGSoC organizers for giving us this opportunity. And we hope that with your love, endeavours and encouragement, many other girls like us can have this metamorphic experience.


## What we learnt this summer
The goal of the project was to develop a Parallelized and Distributed Radix Sort. It has been a mind stimulating experience with loads to learn owing to the challenges that came our way. Starting from a simple version of Least Significant Bit radix sort, progressing over to a recursive Most Significant version, and then trying out various ways to parallelize the algorithm, and finally looking at how to make the sort work in a distributed manner using multiple locales. The work involved trial and experimentation on the code and comparing execution time of the various versions of the code. Our codes went through numerous iterations of feedback from the coaches and mentors which helped us improve immensely. We learnt about the art of performance testing to be able to evaluate how well our code is performing, and along with that being able to point out what parts of our code need to be optimized for improving overall performance. We are in a position to say that we have a fair  understanding of what seemed like big words like Parallelism and Distributed Computing, to us in the beginning of summer.  

Due to the constant encouragement of our coaches and mentors, we are no longer afraid to ask for help and have learnt that no question asked is silly. They were always ahead of us in extending the helping hand, and responding quickly to our queries on the gitter channel. We learnt about how to collaborate as a team, working on different tasks, while keeping track of the overall progress. We learnt the importance of effective communication and the art of being patient while testing and writing code. We are thankful to them for providing us such a positive environment to be able to learn and grow along the way.

### Next Steps:
We feel that we would now be able to make a smooth transition into the world of open source. We are no more dubious of our selves while trying out to figure out how to contribute to open source and whether what we do would be suffice,  we would now definitely just dive right in! 
And we feel there are no better words to express how we feel for RGSoC than to say.
