# Little Infinity

_Dear RGSoC,_
_You gave us forever within the numbered days, and we are grateful <3_

![The two of us :D](/img/blog/2018/rgsoc-2019-09-15-101daysofsummer-blog2-01.jpeg)

_And time the tyrant in whose reign nothing does last,_
_Much like the deepest bliss and the rarest fix,_
_This tempestuous timelessness too did pass_

We didn't realise until we started writing this blog that it has been 11 weeks! 
11 weeks of contributing to Probot, 
11 weeks of reflecting over every day's work in daily logs, 
11 weeks of learning to write production code, 
11 weeks of bonding to a community we'll never let go,
11 weeks of living our long cherished dream <3

## About our work with Probot - 

- Our main task was to develop bots to automate github workflow using Probot. We developed the following 2 bots!
	-First timers only bot ![See here](https://github.com/probot/first-timers-only-app)
	-Enforce template bot ![See here](https://github.com/probot/enforce-template-app)

## And we learned... - 📝

## Quantification in numbers :P

- We created 2 repositories in Probot's beautiful codebase!
- We made over 50 commits in the two repositories
- We wrote approximately 2000 lines of code
- Both of our bots are installed on their repositories themselves.


## What's next?

Probot's going to stay with us, _forever and a day._ We have ideated on future scope of both of our bots (can be found in their respective readmes) and will contibue working on improving them. 
We're already working on boosting the open source culture in our local community and atleast a dozen juniors and batchmates have already approached us, expressing interest for open source in general and RGSoC in particular. We were impacted by our seniors RGSoC 2017 scholars Prachi and Ipshita <3 and we hope to continue to pass it on so that the legacy continues! :D
